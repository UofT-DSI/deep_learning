    "# Assignment 2 – Zero-Shot Image Classification with Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will apply a pre-trained vision–language transformer (e.g. CLIP) to perform **zero-shot** classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset—classifying each image without any task-specific training. You will build on the concepts from Assignment 1 by comparing this “off-the-shelf” approach to the CNN you previously trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "1. **Load** the Fashion-MNIST images using PyTorch instead of Keras.\n",
    "2. **Run a zero-shot baseline** with simple text prompts to set a performance reference.\n",
    "3. **Engineer improved prompts** and measure the resulting accuracy gains.\n",
    "4. **Visualise image embeddings** with UMAP to inspect class separability.\n",
    "5. **Conduct one mini-experiment** of your choice.\n",
    "6. **Summarise findings** and reflect on strengths and weaknesses of zero-shot transformers versus a trained CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Loading the Fashion-MNIST Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "As in assignment 1, we'll load the Fashion-MNIST dataset, but this time using `torchvision.datasets` to ensure compatibility with the `transformers` library. We will also load our model and processor from the `transformers` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformers library allows us to use pre-trained models like CLIP, which can perform zero-shot classification by leveraging the text prompts we provide. There are two key objects we will use: the `CLIPModel` for the model itself and the `CLIPProcessor` for preparing our images and text prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are not actually training a model in this assignment, we will set the CLIP model to evaluation mode. If the model is designed to utilize features like dropout or batch normalization, setting it to evaluation mode ensures that these features behave correctly during inference (prediction). Setting the model to evaluaton mode also tells PyTorch that we don't have to compute gradients, which can save memory and speed up inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to speed up processing, we will also move the model to an \"accelerator\" if available. This is typically a GPU, but modern MacBooks also have an \"Apple Silicon\" accelerator that can be used for inference, called MPS (Metal Performance Shaders). If you are using a MacBook with Apple Silicon, you can use the MPS device for faster processing."

    "\n",
    "In Assignment 1, we followed the typical machine-learning pipeline: we trained a CNN on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, using labelled examples to update the model’s weights. While effective, that approach requires a curated, task-specific training set—a luxury you don’t always have in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot classification flips the script.  A large vision–language model (VLM) such as **CLIP** is first pre-trained on hundreds of millions of image–text pairs scraped from the web.  Because it learns *joint* visual–textual embeddings, the model can later solve new tasks simply by “measuring” how similar an image is to a **text prompt** that describes each candidate class—without seeing a single task-labelled example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**  \n",
    "1. Feed an image through CLIP’s vision encoder → **image feature**.  \n",
    "2. Feed a textual prompt (e.g. “a photo of a sandal”) through CLIP’s text encoder → **text feature**.  \n",
    "3. Compute cosine similarity between the image feature and every class’s text feature.  \n",
    "4. Pick the class whose prompt is most similar.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far we have been utilizing OpenAI's CLIP model for zero-shot classification. However, there are many other vision–language models available in the `transformers` library that you can experiment with. For example, there are larger CLIP models such as [clip-vit-large-patch14](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14), and open-source versions such as [laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-laion2B-s34B-b79K](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-laion2B-s34B-b79K). You can also search huggingface [here](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=clip) to find other models that might be suitable for zero-shot classification.\n",

    "- [ ] Reflect on the performance of the new model compared to the original CLIP model\n",
    "  - How does the new model perform compared to the original CLIP model?\n",
    "  - Do you notice any differences in the types of errors made by the new model?\n",

    "### B. Multiple-Description Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting experiment is to explore multiple-description classification. *This involves providing multiple text prompts for each class, allowing the model to choose the most relevant one. For example, instead of just \"T-shirt/top\", you could provide \"a photo of a T-shirt\", \"a photo of a top\", and \"a photo of a shirt\". This can help the model better understand the class and increases the likelihood of a correct prediction. You should:\n",

    "- [ ] Consider the model to be correct if it guesses *any* of the prompts belonging to the correct class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Top-K Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In some classification tasks, it can be useful to consider if the right answer is among the top K (e.g. top 3) predictions. This can be particularly useful in cases where the model is uncertain or when there are multiple similar classes. You should:\n",
    "\n",

    "- [ ] Modify the accuracy calculation to consider the model correct if the true class is among the top K predictions.\n",
