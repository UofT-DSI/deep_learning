    "# 3. Text Generation (Complete or Incomplete)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a method called `generate_text` that uses the trained model to generate new text. The method should take the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `model`: The trained RNN model.\n",
    "*   `tokenizer`: The tokenizer used to pre-process the text data.\n",
    "*   `seed_text`: The seed text the model will use to generate new text.\n",
    "*   `max_sequence_len`: The maximum length of the sequence used to generate new text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method should return the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "An overview of the text generation process you should follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokenize the seed text using the tokenizer we built before.\n",
    "2. Pad the sequences to the same length as the training sequences - you can use the `pad_sequences` method from the `keras.preprocessing.sequence` module, which is documented [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/sequence/pad_sequences).\n",
    "3. Use the model to predict the next token in the sequence. Remember that the model will output a probability distribution over the vocabulary, so you'll need to use `np.argmax` to find the token with the highest probability.\n",
    "4. Add the predicted token to the sequence and remove the first token.\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 3-4 until you have generated the desired number of tokens.\n",
    "6. Convert the generated token IDs back to words and return the combined result as a single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a challenging task, so don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. It's okay if the generated text doesn't make much sense yet - we'll work on improving the model next.\n",
    "As a bonus, you can make your method generate \"gpt-style\" by having it print out each word as it's generated, so you can see the text being generated in real time."
